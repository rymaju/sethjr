## Description

Seth Jr. is a robot created for [CS4973](https://sethpate.github.io/cs4973/).

For our robot demo, implemented a program to be run on an Interbotix robotic arm that listens to the user through a microphone, then reacts depending on the seniment of what was said.

Seth Jr. is powered by OpenAI Whisper, and can understand a wide range of languages.

When Seth Jr. hears enough happy phrases, it does a dance!

When Seth Jr. hears enough sad phrases, it rotates 180 degrees and *unplugs itself*.


## Installation

Install the relevant Interbotix software ([instructions](https://sethpate.github.io/cs4973/robots)).
